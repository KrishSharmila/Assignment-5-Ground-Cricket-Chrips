Ground Criket Chirps

In The Song of Insects (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures. Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature. Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.

In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60ยบ F. or warmer than 100ยบ F.
